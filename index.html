        <h3> Scratch </h3>
        <p> I’ve been Scratching ever since, like, year 3 in primary school. I’ve created numerous high-quality games throughout the years, which you can find on my (now very inactive) <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Sup2point0">profile</a>. </p>
        <h3> Python </h3>
        <p> I first touched this at the end of primary school, but didn’t properly pick it up until I got involved with *The Monkeyopolis Times* and helped work on our server bot. That then led me to work on my own bot {PENGUIN}, which skyrocketed my understanding of Python. I’m now highly comfortable and confident in Python (I think I can call myself ‘fluent’, whatever that might mean). </p>
        <h3> C# </h3>
        <p> I recently started properly delving into this, after non-committally ‘trying’ to learn it for a while. And honestly, I really should’ve done this sooner, cuz I picked it up *really* quickly – like, way more quickly than I imagined. Turns out already knowing one programming language and having a solid understanding of coding fundamentals makes other languages unimaginably easier to learn; half the deal is just translating syntax, after all. </p>
